- function that build the level gradually, to make it automatically compute things, and also to make it more immersive (with an animation maybe?)
- on start, the camera looks around the level (like in Angry Birds, idk)



edge size restrictions - you can lift them off, but the level doesn't count when finished - make it show a circle around the first point with proper radius, clicking outside the circle will make the edge with max lenght and proper angle

delete also replaces (when the edge type is different) maybe????, it will be harder to check the lenght requirement, maybe leave it in?

edge max amount (i meant max amount of edges...)

point-line intersections in math.js
- check if point under/over/on the line




A couple of levels

Difficulty levels: Different types of cars/people/machines that need to cross your bridge, they have their own mass and sometimes requirements:
- Three school children [3x 80kg]
- 
- 
- 
- A long train [200000kg]
- A Tesla cybertruck [3025kg] (it blows up under the smallest complication with the road) [It's funny, that's why]

Types of budget management for each level:
- Infinite budget (You don't have to worry about it at all)
- Normal budget (Set amount of cash that you can go over, but you will score less)
- Tight budget (50% of the normal budget)
